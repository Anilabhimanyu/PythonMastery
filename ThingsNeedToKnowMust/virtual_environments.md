# Python Project with Virtual Environment

This project demonstrates how to use a **Python Virtual Environment (venv)** to manage project-specific dependencies and avoid conflicts with global Python packages.

---

## üß† What is a Virtual Environment?

A **virtual environment** is an isolated workspace for a Python project. It allows you to install packages locally for the project, without affecting other projects or the system Python installation.

Benefits include:

- Isolated project dependencies  
- Avoid version conflicts  
- Keep global Python clean  
- Easy to deploy and share projects

## üéØ Why Use Virtual Environments

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|
| One project needs Django 3.2, another needs Django 5.0 | Each project gets its own isolated venv |
| Avoid version conflicts globally | Packages are installed locally per project |
| Keep global Python clean | Only project-specific dependencies exist |
| Easy deployment | Export and recreate exact dependencies anywhere |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
````

* `venv` is the folder name (you can name it anything).
* Creates a folder structure with `Scripts/` (Windows) or `bin/` (Linux/Mac).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Activate the environment

**Windows:**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux / Mac:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

You will see your terminal prompt change to something like:

```
(venv) C:\project>
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install packages inside the virtual environment

```bash
pip install <package_name>
```

Example:

```bash
pip install django requests
```

> Packages installed here are isolated to this project.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Check installed packages

```bash
pip list
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Save dependencies to a file

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This creates a file with exact package versions:

```
Django==5.1.1
requests==2.32.3
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Recreate environment from requirements

If someone else clones your repo, they can rebuild the environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Deactivate the environment

```bash
deactivate
```

## ‚ö° Best Practices

* Always use a **virtual environment** for each project
* **Add `venv/` to `.gitignore`** to avoid committing it to Git
* Upgrade pip inside venv if needed:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

* Use specific Python versions if your project requires:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
```

* Check Python version inside venv:

```bash
python --version
```

---

## üöÄ Real-World Example

For a Django project:

```bash
# Create venv
python -m venv venv

# Activate venv
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate    # Linux/Mac

# Install dependencies
pip install django djangorestframework

# Save dependencies
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Run Django server
python manage.py runserver
```

---

## üìå Summary

Virtual environments are **essential for Python development** to:

* Isolate project dependencies
* Avoid version conflicts between projects
* Keep your global Python environment clean
* Ensure reproducible deployments

By using `venv`, you can easily manage packages, share projects with others, and maintain consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

| Task                             | Command                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Create virtual environment       | `python -m venv venv`                 |
| Activate environment (Windows)   | `venv\Scripts\activate`               |
| Activate environment (Linux/Mac) | `source venv/bin/activate`            |
| Install a package                | `pip install <package_name>`          |
| List installed packages          | `pip list`                            |
| Save dependencies                | `pip freeze > requirements.txt`       |
| Install from requirements        | `pip install -r requirements.txt`     |
| Deactivate environment           | `deactivate`                          |
| Upgrade pip                      | `python -m pip install --upgrade pip` |
| Check Python version             | `python --version`                    |

## üìù Notes

* Always add the `venv/` folder to your `.gitignore` file to avoid pushing it to Git repositories.
* Virtual environments **do not affect global Python** ‚Äî you can have multiple venvs with different Python versions or package versions.
* Using virtual environments is a **best practice** for any Python project, whether small scripts or large web applications.
